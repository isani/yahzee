#Project Yahzee - defining the project topic

Topic: Project Yahzee is an attempt at making the classic dice game of yahtzee (notice the difference in spelling to avoid problems with trademark owners...) into an electronic format. If time and energy allow, possible ways to extend this project are 1) makign yahzee playable on any dice, not just the common six-sided one (also known as d6 later in this document, a number of d6 can be written as nd6, where the n denotes the number of dice to be thrown. Also, a ten-sided die can be written as d10, and so on.)

Users: All the wonderful people interested in playing the amazing game of yahzee.
